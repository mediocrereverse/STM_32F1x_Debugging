# STM_32F1x_Debugging
stm32 debugging using the st-link v2 and serial wire debugging (SWD). This is a very easy taught level of some of the basics of debugging for on chip operations without the money to afford something as awesome as a lauterbach or pe micro. 

For starters we have to aquire some POS device to actually try some stuff on. Something not too complicated and easy to learn in a few days/ weeks at max. Oh and remember in this case chat gpt is at your disposal. If you have questions through this process that I cannot answer, please feel free to ask chatgpt. Something preferably under 15$, small, and easy to setup. The best thing for this that I have found that is easy to aquire is the stlink kits with an stm32 on ebay. The stlink will provide a direct connection to the stm32 and will take serial traffic from openocd and telnet commands and send them to the stm32. Think of it as an interperter. Here is a link /example. https://www.ebay.com/itm/404241984023 . This one should also have some base code on it. Something like an led blinking or something. M
